## Structure and Usage
working codes are found in the code folder
necessary files to run code on is found in code folder except .fasta files for UnixPrac1.txt which are stored in data folder
results folder should be populated with output from code

#### code
boilerplate.sh (Prints "this is a shell script)\
variable.sh (shows the use of variables and how to read multivariables)\
CompileLaTex.sh (converts .tex files to .pdf with citations from .bib)\
ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh (combines file1 and file2 into file3, outputs to data)\
CountLine.sh (shows counts number of lines in a file)\
csvrospace.sh (converts .csv file to .txt file)\

exampleTIF.tif (file to be converted into png with tiff2png.sh)\
exampleTIF.png (output file from tiff2png.sh)\
FirstBibiol.bib (bibliography for use with CompileLaTex.sh)\
FirstExample.tex (tex file to be converted to pdf with CompileLaTex.sh)\
FitstExample.pdf (output file from CompileLaTex.sh)\
test.txt (test file to be used with CountLine.sh)\
test2.txt (test file to be used with CountLine.sh)\
test3.txt (test file to be used with CountLine.sh)\

#### data
