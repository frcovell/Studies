## Structure and Usage\
Direcory is spliting into week, within each week working codes are found in the code folder
necessary data to run code on is found in data folder
results folder should be populated with output from code

#### MiniProject
PopGrowthData.py\
PopGrowthModel.R\
PopGrowthResult.R\
report.tex\
CodeRun.sh

#### Week1
boilerplate.sh (Prints "this is a shell script)\
variable.sh (shows the use of variables and how to read multivariables)\
CompileLaTex.sh (converts .tex files to .pdf with citations from .bib)\
ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh (combines file1 and file2 into file3, outputs to data)\
CountLine.sh (shows counts number of lines in a file)\
csvrospace.sh (converts .csv file to .txt file)\
tabtocsv.sh (converts .txt file to .csv file)\

loops.py (explore the use of for and while loops implementation)\
lc2.py (using lost comprhesion and loops to look at rainfall during different months)\
lc1.py (using lost comprhesion and loops to look at birds latin name, common name and mass)\
dictionary.py (create a dictionary of taxa, mapping name to set)\
debugme.py(looks at zero devision error and try function to allow debugging)\
control_flow.py(look at conrtol flow, create 5 function to be called by main function)\
cfexercise2.py (examples of combining loops and conditionals)\
cfexercise1.py (6 function to look at different conditionals)\
boilerplate.py (Prints "this is a boilerplate")\
basic_io3.py (creats a dictionary)\
basic_io2.py (modifies a txt file)\
basic_io1.py (different exaples of ways to open txt file)\
basic_csv.py (opens cvs and writes new csv files)\
align_seq.py (program to compare scores of different sequence alignments)

#### Week3
apply1.R (Build matix, look at mean by row, column and varience)\
apply2.R (create SomeOperation to time inputs greater then 0 by 100, run on randomly filled 10 by 10 matrix)\
basic_io.R (A simple script to illustrate R input-output)\
boilerplate.R (function to test class of two inputs)\
browse.R (Runs a simulation of exponential growth)\
control_flow.R (looks at if statments for and while loops)\
DataWrang.R (reshape PoundHillData.csv)\
DataWrangTidy.R (tidy PoundHillData.csv)\
Florida.R (Look at difference in Temperature between years and check for significants)\
get_TreeHieght.py (group work, Program to compare tree hieghts of input file)\
get_TreeHieght.R (group work, Program to compare tree hieghts of input file)\
Gikro.R (plots ellipse)\
GPDD_Data.R (map the Global Population Dynamics Database)\
MyBars.R (creates barplots)\
plotLin.R (creates line graph)\
PP_Dists.R (draw and save 3 figs, subplotting by Predator mass, prey mass and size ratio, and calculate the log mean and median)\
PP_Regress.R (run linear models on data based on feeding type and life stage)\
PP_Regress_loc.R (group work, run linear models on data based on feeding type, life stage and location)\
preallocate.R (look at effects of preallcation on run time)\
R_conditionals.R(function to check even and power of 2)\
Ricker.R (function to simulate Ricker model)\
run_get_TreeHeight.sh (groupwork, Runs get_TreeHeight.r and get_TreeHeight.py on trees.csv from bash)\
sample.R (look at loop vs vectorization with and without preallocation on run time)\
TAutoCorr.R(group work, Look at difference in Temperature between sussecive years and check for significants)\
TreeHeight.R (calculate Height based on angle and distance)\
try.R (use try function to supresses errorr messages)\
