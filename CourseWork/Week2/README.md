# Week 2

## Description
Week 2 in class codes and praticles 

## Languages
unix Ubuntu version 20.04.3 LTS\
Python 3.8.10
 
## Dependencies
- sys
- doctest
- pickle
- csv

## Structure and Usage
working codes are found in the code folder
necessary data to run code on is found in data folder
results folder should be populated with output from code

#### code
using_name.py (usning __name__ == '__main__')\
tuple.py (output birds latin name, common name and mass in easy to read format)\
test_contol_flow.py (functions to look at control statment)\
sysargv.py (print arguments passed via command line)\
scope.py (explores global and local varialbe by redefining a_function)\
oaks.py (using list comprehesion and loops to check taxa for oaks)\
oaks_debugme_grp.py (group work use doctest to debug is_an_oak function and  excludes the header row)\
oaks_debugme.py (use doctest to debug is_an_oak function)\
MyExapleScript.py (example script, squares input value and prints answer)\
loops.py (explore the use of for and while loops implementation)\
lc2.py (using lost comprhesion and loops to look at rainfall during different months)\
lc1.py (using lost comprhesion and loops to look at birds latin name, common name and mass)\
dictionary.py (create a dictionary of taxa, mapping name to set)\
debugme.py(looks at zero devision error and try function to allow debugging)\
control_flow.py(look at conrtol flow, create 5 function to be called by main function)\
cfexercise2.py (examples of combining loops and conditionals)\
cfexercise1.py (6 function to look at different conditionals)\
boilerplate.py (Prints "this is a boilerplate")\
basic_io3.py (creats a dictionary)\
basic_io2.py (modifies a txt file)\
basic_io1.py (different exaples of ways to open txt file)\
basic_csv.py (opens cvs and writes new csv files)\
align_seq_fasta.py(group work, take any two fasta sequence compare scores of alignments)\
align_seq.py (program to compare scores of different sequence alignments)\
align_seq_better.py(group work, equally-best alignments are recorded and saved)

#### data
BestAlignment.txt\
JustOaksData.csv\
TestOaksData.csv\
bodymass.csv\
pickle\
sequence.csv\
test.txt\
testcsv.csv\
testout.txt\
testp.p
#### fasta
407228326.fasta\
407228412.fasta\
