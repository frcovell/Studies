# Week 3

## Description 
Week 3 in class codes and praticles 

## Languages
unix Ubuntu version 20.04.3 LTS\
R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01)
Python 3.8.10
 
## Dependencies
#### R:
- ggplot2
- ggthemes
- reshape2
- tidyverse
- maps
- plyr

#### Python:
- sys
- math
- pandas
- csv


## Structure and Usage
working codes are found in the code folder
necessary data to run code on is found in data folder
results folder should be populated with output from code

#### code
apply1.R (Build matix, look at mean by row, column and varience)\
apply2.R (create SomeOperation to time inputs greater then 0 by 100, run on randomly filled 10 by 10 matrix)\
basic_io.R (A simple script to illustrate R input-output)\
boilerplate.R (function to test class of two inputs)\
browse.R (Runs a simulation of exponential growth)\
control_flow.R (looks at if statments for and while loops)\
DataWrang.R (reshape PoundHillData.csv)\
DataWrangTidy.R (tidy PoundHillData.csv)\
Florida.R (Look at difference in Temperature between years and check for significants)\
get_TreeHieght.py (group work, Program to compare tree hieghts of input file)\
get_TreeHieght.R (group work, Program to compare tree hieghts of input file)\
Gikro.R (plots ellipse)\
GPDD_Data.R (map the Global Population Dynamics Database)\
MyBars.R (creates barplots)\
plotLin.R (creates line graph)\
PP_Dists.R (draw and save 3 figs, subplotting by Predator mass, prey mass and size ratio, and calculate the log mean and median)\
PP_Regress.R (run linear models on data based on feeding type and life stage)\
PP_Regress_loc.R (group work, run linear models on data based on feeding type, life stage and location)\
preallocate.R (look at effects of preallcation on run time)\
R_conditionals.R(function to check even and power of 2)\
Ricker.R (function to simulate Ricker model)\
run_get_TreeHeight.sh (groupwork, Runs get_TreeHeight.r and get_TreeHeight.py on trees.csv from bash)\
sample.R (look at loop vs vectorization with and without preallocation on run time)\
TAutoCorr.R(group work, Look at difference in Temperature between sussecive years and check for significants)\
TreeHeight.R (calculate Height based on angle and distance)\
try.R (use try function to supresses errorr messages)\
Vectorize1.R (use in-built vectorize function to inprove run time)\
Vectorize2.R (vectorize Ricker model to improve run time)
